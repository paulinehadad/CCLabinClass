OpenFrameworks - Homework 1
============

I used the example of the ball bouncing with soundPlayerFFTExample to have the ball making a sound 
when it hits a side of the window (either left or right). So instead of simply bouncing from left to right, 
the ball will start a sound of a dog or of a beat when hitting the left or right wall.
