OpenFrameworks - Final Project

Name of project: The DJ Head

Goal of project: When the user moves his/her head to different position of the screen, it will activate different sounds. For example, if the user moves his head to the bottom left, it might play some Beyonce sound.
I added some bubbles in the background just as a display.

Next Steps: For future iterations, I would like to have better-defined positions that activate a certain sound (corner top left, top right...). I would also like to make a game where the user pops bubbles with his hands (with motion detection). It was my initial goal with this project but didn't get to that.
